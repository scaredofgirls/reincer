race:
  name: lizardman
  description: >
    Lizardmen are savage, semi-aquatic, reptilian humanoids that live
    through scavenging, raiding, and in less hostile areas, by fishing
    and gathering. Adult lizardmen stand 6-7 feet tall, weighing 200 to
    250 pounds. Skin tones range from dark green to grey and brown. They
    are scaled and have a flecked appearance. Their tails are 3-4 feet
    long and although not prehensile are quite expressive. Males are
    nearly impossible to distinguish from females without either asking
    or close inspection. About one tribe in ten has evolved to a higher
    state and it is these lizardmen that are sometimes seen adventuring.
